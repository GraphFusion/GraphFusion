# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.1.1 — 2026-09-27

First release of the GraphFusion database and CLI.

- Execute GQL graph queries through DataFusion, including optional matches,
  quantified/shortest paths, element references, aggregation, and query composition.
- Insert, update, and delete graph data with statement atomicity and explicit
  transactions.
- Manage catalog objects and isolated sessions, return Arrow batches, and persist
  local databases with Parquet, a write-ahead log, and checkpoints.
- Provide a Rust embedding API, CLI, runnable examples, and searchable documentation.
- Publish both crates at 0.1.1 and preserve the parser library name
  `graphfusion_gql_parser` used by existing consumers.
- Fix parsing of nested query results and parenthesized path patterns.

Rust 1.94 or newer is required. Durable storage supports Linux and macOS on local
filesystems. Full ISO GQL conformance and all syntax accepted by the parser are
not yet supported by the execution engine; see the
[support matrix](https://graphfusion.github.io/start/status/) and
[limits](https://graphfusion.github.io/storage/limits/).
